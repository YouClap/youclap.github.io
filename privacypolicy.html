            <h3>Welcome to YouClap!</h3>
            <span>YouClap is a platform where users can engage with each other, by creating and participating in challenges. When you use these services, you’ll share some information with us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, update, and delete your information.</span>
            <span>That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, please</span><a href="mailto:dpo@getyouclap.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">contact us (dpo@getyouclap.com)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This privacy policy is part of our</span><a href="termsofservice.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">terms of service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, being applied to all users of the YouClap website and mobile application.</span>
            <span>We may change our service and associated policies. Whenever we make changes that affect your rights under our Terms, we will notify you through our mobile application, website and/or email before the changes come into effect, giving you the opportunity to review them. Continuing to use YouClap after a change to these terms or policies means you accept and are bound by the new terms.</span>
            <b>Controller - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Clapware, Lda, a Portuguese company, tax no 514224002 and with its head office at Portugal, Incubadora de Empresas da Universidade de Aveiro, Campus Universitário de Santiago, Edifício 1, Aveiro, Glória e Vera Cruz, 3810-193 Aveiro.</span></b>
            <h3><strong>1. Information we collect</strong></h3>
            <h3><strong>1.1 Information you provide</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide you with our service, we must process information about you. This information is provided when you use YouClap, including when you create an account, create or share content or contact us. To create an account on YouClap you have to provide the following data:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><b> </b><b>Username - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">required for basic identification of your account.</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Email address -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for basic identification of your account. </span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Password -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for basic identification of your account.</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Name -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside your username, this allows other users to search for your profile in-app.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also optionally add a profile picture, which we will store to ensure it’s displayed whenever users search for your profile.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also sign up using a Facebook account and email address. We will ask permission to access basic information from that account, in order to fill the required fields above (email address, password, name) and your profile picture. You can choose to stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing YouClap’s access to that account.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your username, name and profile picture can be seen by other users in-app, with the remaining ones being private to you, as the account owner, and accessible through your Profile Settings.</span>
            <h3><strong>1.2 Information we get from third parties</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect information automatically as you navigate the site or mobile application, including through our third party analytics providers. This includes device attributes, information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, app and file names.</span>
            <strong>1.2.1 Google Analytics</strong>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Google Analytics to provide us standard log information and details of your behaviour patterns when you use the service. This information is only processed in a non identifiable way and we anonymize your IP address when you access our website. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of our users. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information, we will always inform you, making it clear and explaining what we intend to do it. We encourage you to read the</span><a href="//policies.google.com/privacy"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you prefer to not have data reported by Google Analytics on our website, you can install the</span><a href="//tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
            <strong>1.2.2 Wordpress</strong>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We use WordPress to publish our website, which automatically collects anonymous information about users’ activity. WordPress is run by Automattic Inc, and we encourage you to read</span><a href="//automattic.com/privacy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Automattic’s Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We always try to keep our list of third party analytics providers updated but we may experiment with new options, so this list may not be exhaustive.</span>
            <h3><strong>1.3 When you contact us</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you email us, we collect your email address, associated name and the content of your email (this includes text, images and any other annexed elements). We will also monitor any emails sent to us, including file attachments, for viruses or malicious software. This occurs when you email us through your preferred email provider, through the Contact Form on our website or through in-app mechanisms.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt and protect email traffic. If your email service does not support TLS, you should be aware that any emails we send or receive may not be protected in transit.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that you have a responsibility to ensure that any email you send is within the bounds of the law.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Our website and email provider is hosted in amen and we encourage you to read</span><a href="//www.amen.pt/company/legal/cookie/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">amen’s Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
            <h3><strong>2. How we use your information</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We never sell your information to anyone. We use the information we collect in order to provide YouClap to you. Additionally, we use it for the following purposes:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><b> </b><b>Research and development - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">we use this information to develop, test and improve our service, including by conducting surveys and research, as well as testing and troubleshooting features.</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Ensure user safety - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">we use this information to verify user accounts and activity, in order to combat detrimental behaviour, prevent spam and ensure an overall safe and secure environment that respects our terms and policies.</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Communicate with you - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">we this information in order to notify you whenever we deem necessary, such as informing you about any changes to our terms and policies, or to respond to you whenever you contact us.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>3. Information shared in-app</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create content in YouClap you can control who sees it. When creating a challenge:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><b> </b><b>Public - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you create a public challenge, it will be visible to everyone on the platform. It will appear in the Home feed of your followers, on your profile (which others may visit) and, possibly, in the Explore feed if your challenge is suggested to other users.</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Private - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you create a private challenge, you can individually control the users you are challenging. This challenge will appear in the Home feed of those you selected and will be visible on your profile for those that you selected.</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Group -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you create a group challenge, it will appear in the Home feed of the group’s members and will be visible inside a group’s challenge feed.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are posting on someone’s challenge:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><b> </b><b>Public - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you post something on a public challenge, it will be visible to everyone on the platform. It will appear in the challenge’s feed, the Home feed of your followers, on your profile (which others may visit).</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Private - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you post something on a private challenge, it will be visible to everyone that was individually selected by the challenge’s creator, including the challenge’s feed, in the Home feed of those that were selected and follow you and if they visit your profile.</span></li>
                <li><b> </b><b>Group - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you post something on a group challenge, it will be visible to everyone that’s a member of the group, including in the challenge’s feed and their Home feeds, if they also follow you.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your profile may also be suggested for other users to follow in the Explore feed.</span>
            <h3><strong>4. Information shared with third parties</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is data that includes a personal identifier like your name, email or address, or data that could reasonably be linked back to you. We will only share this data under the following circumstances:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">With companies that are contractually binded as service providers, such as email management and data trends analysis. These companies may have access to personal information to perform their services and are obligated by contract to safeguard any PII they receive from us.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g. subpoenas or warrants served on us), to protect our security or integrity, and to protect our rights, property, or safety, including that of, its employees, users, or others. If we are ever required to release your data, we will do our best to notify in advance by email, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose or transfer your data in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company. We will notify you if a different company receives your PII. The promises in this privacy policy apply to any data transferred to a new entity.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>5. Legal basis for data processing</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect, use and share all of the previously mentioned data as follows:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a manner that allows us to fulfill our Terms of Service and other policies.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect your vital interest, or those of others.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As required by public interest.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As required for our (or others’) legitimate interests, including in order to provide a safe, viable and profitable service to our users and partners, unless those interests are overruled by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of your personal data.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>6. Enforcing your rights under the GDPR</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the General Data Protection Regulation – REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) -, you have the right to access, rectify, port and erase your data.  You also have the right to object to and restrict certain processing of your data. This includes:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can withdraw your consent for us to process your data at any time by deleting your account, which you can do in-app through the Settings screen. However, this does not affect any processing carried out until such date based on any consent previously provided.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can access all of the data we’ve collected from you at any time, through the in-app Settings screen and selecting “Download your data”. By requesting this download, we’ll send you a link within 72 hours to access all of your personal data.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ever want to delete your account, just go to Settings on your Profile screen. Upon selecting “Delete account” and confirming your intent, we will delete your information from our servers.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can control who sees your content based on how you choose to share it, as mentioned above (see “5. Information shared in-app”). Additionally, you can delete your content at any time, hide any content from other users you don’t want to see and block any user in the service.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can rectify your personal info, by editing your profile in-app through the Settings menu.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can complete these actions or alter these settings either in-app, through the Settings screen, or by</span><a href="mailto:dpo@getyouclap.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">contacting us (dpo@getyouclap.com)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>7. Data Retention</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our service, or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is determined on a case-by-case basis that varies according to the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs.</span>
            <h3><strong>8. External links</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">This policy only applies to the collection and processing of personal data carried out by us. You may find links on the service to access other websites that are unrelated to us. Thus, the provision of links to other websites/platforms outside does not imply any assumption of responsibility or liability for such websites and therefore this policy is not applicable to them. We always encourage you to read the privacy policies of such platforms.</span>
            <h3><strong>9. Security</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The security of your personal information is important to us and we follow industry standards to protect it and prevent it from being accidentally lost or accessed in an unauthorised manner. We ensure that access to your personal data is limited to those that have a genuine business need to view it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">To further protect your information we suggest using a strong and unique password for your YouClap account.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so. </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted through any online means, therefore any transmission remains at your own risk.</span>
            <h3><strong>10. Response to legal requests</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We may access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others to comply with the law and prevent harm. Namely:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a legal request, if we have good-faith belief that we are required to do so by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and respects internationally recognized standards.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have a good-faith belief it is required to detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of our service, violations of our terms or policies, or any form or harmful or illegal activity; when it is required to protect ourselves (including our rights, property and service), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; when required in order to prevent death or harm.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Information we collect may also be accessed and preserved for an extended period of time if it is subject to a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or investigations of possible violations our terms or policies or if we deem it necessary to prevent harm.</span>
            <h3><strong>11. Complaints</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial proceedings, as Data Subject, under the law, you are entitled to file a complaint before a Data Protection Authority or any other relevant authority, in case you consider that the processing of your personal data violates the legal framework in force.</span>
            <h3><strong>12. Contact information</strong></h3>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may contact us for all questions relating to the processing of your personal data and enforcement of the rights granted under applicable legislation and, in particular, those set out in this privacy policy, which will be handled by our Data Protection Officer, at:</span>
